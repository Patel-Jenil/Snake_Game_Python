# Snake Game using Python and Tkinter module

The base of this game is taken from https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects.git.
As it is open source I tried to add some new features to the Snake_Game project.

Features added: 

    1. Changed the color of head of snake to easily differentiate$Head$ and$Body$ and direction of snake.
